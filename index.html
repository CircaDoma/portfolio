        Hi, I’m Kaleb! 
    </h1>
    <p>
        I make instructional experiences for companies that value learning, not just training. This portfolio showcases some of my work as an assistant instructional designer at BYU Online. Check out some of the projects I worked on.
        <br>
        I now work as a learning experience designer for ADI Global. New projects and content pending!
